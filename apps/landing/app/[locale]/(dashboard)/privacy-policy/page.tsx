          <p>
            At Kalit AI, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we
            collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our platform and
            services. Please read this policy carefully. By using the Service, you consent to the
            practices described herein.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

          <h3>Account Information</h3>
          <p>
            When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and password. If you
            sign up through a third-party provider (e.g., Google, GitHub), we receive your profile
            information from that provider.
          </p>

          <h3>Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            We automatically collect information about how you interact with the Service, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pages visited, features used, and actions taken within the platform.</li>
            <li>Device information (browser type, operating system, screen resolution).</li>
            <li>IP address and approximate geographic location.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Payment Information</h3>
          <p>
            When you subscribe to a paid plan, payment processing is handled by Stripe. We do not
            store your full credit card number on our servers. Stripe may collect your card details,
            billing address, and other payment-related information in accordance with their own
            privacy policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Content You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            We collect and store the data, files, prompts, and other content you upload or input
            into the Service in order to provide our AI-powered features.
          </p>
